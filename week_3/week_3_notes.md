## Gradient

$f(x)$ increseas fastest at the gradient, and decrease fastest at the opposite of the gradient.

### Unconstrained Minimization of function (Multivariate)

### Iterative Solutions
Closed form solutions are not always available
- Iterative solutions
	1. Start from an initial guess $x_0$ for the optimal x
	2. Update the guess towards a “better” value of $f(x)
	3. Initialize $x_0$
	4. While $f’(x^k)\neq=0  x^{k+1}=x^k-\eta^kf’(x^k)$


### Others

- ReLU is not differentiable at certain point (P41)
- For a multi-class classifier with N classes, the one-hot representation will have N binary outputs (An N-dimensional binary vector)
- L2 Divergence? (P62)
